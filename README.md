<br /><br /><br /><br />

### Wouldn't be great if you can know your fortune in you terminal?!

Ok that wasn't useful.

<br /><br /><br /><br />

### But what if it was said by the wise cow:

```bash
fortune | cowsay
```

### It needs more color doesn't it? how about more _lolcat_

```

- lolcat generaly can give any text output a splach of color try piping differnet things to it.

<br /><br /><br /><br />
